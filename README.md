# BuildSpace Starter

Canonical Next.js starter template used when BuildSpace provisions a new app repository.

## Local development

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```

## Deploy in BuildSpace

From a BuildSpace-managed clone:

```bash
buildspace deploy
```

The repository is the source of truth for what gets deployed.
